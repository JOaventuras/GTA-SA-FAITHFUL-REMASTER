# GTA-SA-FAITHFUL-REMASTER
A Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Faithful Remaster, aiming to maximize compatibility for gameplay
<H1>MENU</H1> <br>
1. Requirements <br>
2. Essentials <br>
3. Faithful <br>
4. Optional 1 <br>
5. Optional 2 <br>

   If not stated otherwise install the mods in Mod Loader
   It can be used with any standard save game, except for Story 2.0 (optional and recommended for a replay, more info later)
   Recommended to install the mods as follows, so in case of incompatibilities in gameplay (one mod could crash the game in a bizarre and specific situation) you can just remove the mods by tiers, continue that part of the story, and reinstall the tier.
   There are gonna be incompatibilities almost always, the approach is to limit the script numbers and use good quality mod plus an administration system for them. The main goal is that the game works in general, without crashes and bugs, but is always recommended to have a Essentials Folder of the game.
   In this guide the Essentials Pack is going to be installed one by one, there are no problems using the MixMod Modpack to just install and play, but I recommend knowing what each mod does and if you install the pack be sure you have the same mods at the end.
